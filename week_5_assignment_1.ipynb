    "# 1)Clarity and Readability: Custom exceptions make the code more readable and self-documenting. \n",
    "# By creating specific exception classes, developers can convey the intent and nature of the error more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2)Granular Error Handling: Custom exceptions allow for more granular error handling. Instead of catching a broad exception type, such as Exception or \n",
    "# ValueError, developers can catch specific custom exceptions, enabling them to handle different error scenarios in distinct ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3)Modularity: Custom exceptions contribute to the modularity of the code. They encapsulate error-handling logic related to a specific module or \n",

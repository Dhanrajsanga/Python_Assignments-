    "# charts or graphs.\n",
    "# Key Measures: Includes measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability\n",

    "# Example Use Case: A company might use descriptive statistics to summarize the performance data of its employees. \n",

    "# Use: A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean, whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the\n",
    "# data points are spread out over a wider range. It is more commonly used than variance due to being in the same units as the data.\n",

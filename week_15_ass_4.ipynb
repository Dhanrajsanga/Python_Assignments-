    "# Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique used in statistics \n",
    "# and machine learning. It's an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but with a regularization term added to the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The key feature of Lasso Regression is that it not only minimizes the sum of squared residuals but also adds a penalty term \n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. **Feature selection:** Lasso Regression inherently performs feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. \n",
    "# This makes it useful when dealing with datasets with many predictors, automatically selecting a subset of the most relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Handling multicollinearity:** Lasso Regression is effective in handling multicollinearity, similar to Ridge Regression.\n",
    "# However, Lasso goes a step further by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, addressing multicollinearity more aggressively.\n",

    "# 3. **Sparse models:** The sparsity induced by Lasso leads to simpler, more interpretable models with fewer non-zero coefficients.\n",

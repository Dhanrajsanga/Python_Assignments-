    "# Covariance and correlation are both measures used to assess the relationship between two variables, but they differ in several key aspects:\n",

    "# 1. **Definition:**\n",
    "#    - **Covariance:** Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates whether an increase in one variable \n",
    "#     is associated with an increase or decrease in another. The formula for covariance involves the product of the deviations of each variable \n",
    "#     from their respective means.\n",
    "#    - **Correlation:** Correlation is a standardized measure that expresses the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two \n",
    "# variables. It is calculated by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Scale:**\n",
    "#    - **Covariance:** Covariance is not standardized and can take any value. Its units are the product of the units of the two variables.\n",
    "#    - **Correlation:** Correlation is unitless and standardized, ranging from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear\n",
    "# relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Interpretation:**\n",
    "#    - **Covariance:** The magnitude of covariance is difficult to interpret directly because it depends on the units of the variables.\n",
    "#    - **Correlation:** Correlation provides a clear interpretation of the strength and direction of the linear relationship. \n",
    "# A correlation close to 1 or -1 indicates a strong linear association, while a correlation close to 0 suggests a weak or no linear association.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Independence:**\n",
    "#    - **Covariance:** Covariance can be influenced by the scale of the variables, making it challenging to compare covariances between\n",
    "#     different pairs of variables.\n",
    "#    - **Correlation:** Correlation standardizes the measure, making it easier to compare the strength of relationships between \n",
    "# different pairs of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Range:**\n",
    "#    - **Covariance:** The range of covariance is unbounded.\n",
    "#    - **Correlation:** The range of correlation is from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, while both covariance and correlation assess the relationship between two variables, correlation is a standardized \n",

    "#     A single extreme value can pull the mean towards it, leading to an inaccurate representation of the center of the data.\n",
    "#    - **Median:** The median is less affected by outliers since it depends on the order of values rather than their actual magnitudes. \n",
    "# Outliers have minimal impact on the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "#    - **Range:** Outliers can greatly affect the range, as it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. \n",
    "#     A single outlier can significantly expand the range.\n",
    "#    - **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Outliers can inflate these measures, as they involve squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "# If an outlier has a large deviation from the mean, its squared value will be substantial, impacting both variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Example:**\n",
    "# Consider the dataset: [12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 75]\n",
